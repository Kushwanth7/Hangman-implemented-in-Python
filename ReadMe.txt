# Hangman implemented in Python
# @Author - Kushwanth
# A random word from a list of 55,000 words is selected at random and presented to the user
# The user will be given 10 attempts to predict the word
# User will have to predict the word letter by letter, if the user enters the correct letter, then his number of attempts will not reduce else it decreases by one
#If the user enters a letter which already entered before and present in the word then his number of attempts will not decrease


—————Program—————
#File -> game.py: Contains the actual implementation of the Hangman game
#File -> words.txt: Contains a list of more than 55,000 words

Note - For the program to run correctly, the file words.txt should be present in the same directory as the file game.py
